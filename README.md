# chartoftheweek
Every week I post a chart on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewbridger/) on the key Australian economic data from the week. This repository contains the R code used to reproduce my charts. You can also view my Twitter: [@AndyBridger](https://twitter.com/AndyBridger)

- **Week 33** 

The world container index increased to $9,421 per 40ft container in the week to 12 August 2021, up 358% from the same week in 2020 and up from $1,500 in March 2020.

- **Week 32** 

New data from the OECD comparing minimum wages across the globe. Australia has the highest #MinimumWage in the world for the second year in a row. For the original viz see [here](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/6938383/) and for my quick explainer on the data and the Australian minimum wage see [here](https://www.aigroup.com.au/news/blogs/2021/australia-had-the-highest-minimum-wage-in-the-world-again-in-2020/)

- **Week 31** 

Export prices have increased +170% this century while import prices have increased only 7%. Higher export prices help to support government budgets and national aggregate income.

- **Week 30** 

The #olympics have started but this remains the most important race of all #ausbiz #vaccines

- **Week 29** 

Victorian hours worked declined 8.4% in June due to the 2-week lockdown in the state. The impact of lockdowns is more visible in 'hours worked' rather than 'employment' because many workers' hours are reduced (including to zero) but keep their jobs. Longer lockdowns and the absence of government support increase the probability of job losses. This data pre-dates the recent restrictions in Greater Sydney and Victoria, which will be the first time in 2021 that Australia's two largest cities - accounting for more than half of the Australian economy - have been locked down at the same time.

- **Week 28** 

Job mobility in Australia hit a record low during the pandemic but has been declining for decades. This long-term decline reflects demographic changes (older workers change jobs less frequently) and possibly structural changes. However, compared to the past, when people do change jobs they are more likely to move into different industries and/or change occupational groups.

- **Week 27** 

The Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) Performance of #manufacturing Index grew at a record pace in June. The index is one of Australia's longest-running business surveys dating back to 1992.

- **Week 25** 

Net interstate migration to Queensland has increased substantially during COVID-19 while Victoria experienced its largest decline to other states since the 1990s recession (which, like COVID-19 lockdowns, hit Victoria particularly hard). NSW always loses people to other states (mainly Queensland) but usually has large overseas migration flows which increase its population.

- **Week 24** 

There are more jobs on offer in #regionalaustralia than ever before. There were a record-high 57,500 online vacancies in April which is 65% higher than the pre-COVID-19 average.

- **Week 23** 

Domestic demand is higher than pre-pandemic levels in every state & territory except for #victoria. The current lockdown is likely to push the Victorian recovery further behind the other states.

- **Week 23 Extra** 

Business profit, sales and wages data out today from the ABS. Corporate profits down 0.3% in Q1 2021 but mining profits hit another record high due to iron ore exports.

- **Week 22**

The long-term unemployment rate increased in April - despite the headline rate falling - as those who lost their jobs at the start of the pandemic (April 2020) were added. One-third of all unemployed people in Australia are now long-term unemployed.

- **Week 18**

Retail sales remain well above the pre-COVID-19 trend. Sales growth was strongest in Victoria and Western Australia in March, after short COVID-19 lockdowns in each state dented local retail sales in February 2021.

- **Week 16**

Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) performance indicators released this week show a faster & stronger recovery so far from #covid19 compared to the #GFC. The services sectors were relatively better off during the GFC compared to #construction and #manufacturing, but services industries have been hit harder by COVID-19.

- **Week 15**

The Australian Easter Bunny has been getting busier delivering chocolate to overseas markets. New Zealand accounts for almost half of #aussie chocolate exports but Chinese, American and ASEAN exports have grown substantially in the last decade.

I suspect these two lines will overlap in the coming months as more people return to the office. Worth also remembering over half of the workforce never worked from home (e.g., healthcare, factories, transport, and construction)
